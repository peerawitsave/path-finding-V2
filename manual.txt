Using the Visualization

After running the script, you will see the graph displayed in the window. You can use the following keys to start the different graph traversal algorithms:

Key 1: Runs Depth First Search (DFS) starting from node 'A'.

DFS explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Nodes turn red when they are visited.

Key 2: Runs Breadth First Search (BFS) starting from node 'A'.

BFS explores all nodes at the current level before moving deeper.

Nodes turn red when they are visited.

Key 3: Runs Dijkstra's Algorithm starting from node 'A'.

Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path from the starting node to all other nodes using edge weights.

Nodes turn red as they are visited.
